## Inspiration
On a day to day basis, university students face various challenges such as struggling difficult subjects and are on a tight budget due to student debt. We wanted to solve both problems in one app. Tutorfy makes it simple for students to find local tutors in a plethora of subjects that can help them secure that A+, and helps tutors to earn some extra cash.

## What it does
Allows students to search for tutors in different universities and courses, shows them their prices, reviews, and courses they tutor.

## How we built it
We built Tutorfy using: React, Flask, Python, MongoDB & Git

## Challenges we ran into
We had some challenges with React's uni-directional data flow, especially when implementing states.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Considering it was our first hackathon for all of us, we're definitely proud to have a functioning web app with several components (adding new posts, messaging via email service etc.)

## What we learned
Most of us were new to React, Flask, and creating a web application from scratch. Teamwork started off difficult; Splitting off tasks initially between four developers was unexpected and challenging. We've learnt that communication help solve problems quick and resolve issues with merge conflicts fast.

## What's next for Tutorfy
We're excited to further develop Tutorfy and improve on it's functionality. Some implementations we have in mind is to have the ability to create and store personal accounts for both tutors and students. In addition, we plan to add geo-location features, improved rating/feedback system, and an in-app instant messaging service.

## Built With
React, Flask, Python, MongoDB & Git
